# day 4

Worked on the forming the data in a correct manner and setting up a framework for the site.
Put the datamap on the first page, got a bit annoyed.

# day 5

Did the presentation today, everything was okay. Make sure tooltip exists for data in scatterplot.

# day 6

Busy with getting the data in the right (usable) format. Want to finnish Europe today (opt. with map change), Netherlands tomorrow. Talked with assistant and decided that datastructure would be better if I put them by year and then country.
Thus: [2008 {Belgium {trust in humanity: 5, trust in police: 6}}]
OR [Belgium {2008: {....}} {2010: {...}}]

Questions to ask: how to get data Europe in right structure? how to get data dataNetherlands as response?
