# day 4

Worked on the forming the data in a correct manner and setting up a framework for the site.
Put the datamap on the first page, got a bit annoyed.

# day 5

Did the presentation today, everything was okay. Make sure tooltip exists for data in scatterplot.

# day 6

Busy with getting the data in the right (usable) format. Want to finnish Europe today (opt. with map change), Netherlands tomorrow. Talked with assistant and decided that datastructure would be better if I put them by year and then country.
Thus: [2008 {Belgium {trust in humanity: 5, trust in police: 6}}]
OR [Belgium {2008: {....}} {2010: {...}}]

Questions to ask: how to get data Europe in right structure? how to get data dataNetherlands as response?

# day 7

Got data in right format, now trying to get it working.

# day 8

Working on map, trying to get legend on right spot. Buggy (as in it is showing twice, do not know why).
Also: tooltip in map is not working if added class through stylesheet (why?).

# day 9

page of Europe is working, but style not yet. Also I am missing a link between years and updating the barchart.

page Netherlands needs some attention. Still need to make scatterplot and second linegraph.
IDEA: maybe make new CSS for Netherlands

# day 10 (17-6-2018)

worked on multi line graph today. Data structure not right yet, also in doubt which statistics
should be showing (one from 1950 till now, missing feeling of safety OR one from 1999 to now (missing 2010 and 2011) including feeling of safety). Also dat structure not yet right, but working.
